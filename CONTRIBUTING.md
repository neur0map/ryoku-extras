# Submitting to Ryostore

Thanks for building for Ryoku. This is the one page that gets your work into the
store. It is short on purpose; the deep details live in each catalogue's own
authoring guide, linked below.

**Before you submit, build it and test it live.** The
[DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md) guide shows you how to point your running desktop at
your local copy and watch it work. Do that first; it catches almost everything.

## The shape of a submission

Ryostore is a catalogue repo. Every item is:

1. **A folder** under its catalogue (for example `plugins/my-plugin/` or
   `rices/my-rice/`), with a manifest and a preview image.
2. **One entry** in that catalogue's `registry.json`. The desktop only shows
   items that are listed there.

Pick your catalogue and follow its authoring guide for the folder layout and
manifest fields:

| You are adding | Start from | Full guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A shell plugin (desktop, popout, or QS Bar widget) | `plugins/template/` | [`plugins/AUTHORING.md`](plugins/AUTHORING.md) |
| A rice (whole-desktop look) | Save current setup in Settings | [`rices/AUTHORING.md`](rices/AUTHORING.md) |
| A colour scheme | `colorschemes/template/` | [`colorschemes/AUTHORING.md`](colorschemes/AUTHORING.md) |
| A bundle (tool set) | `bundles/the-ricer/` | [`bundles/README.md`](bundles/README.md) |
| A Nautilus script pack | `nautilus/video-reformat/` | [`nautilus/AUTHORING.md`](nautilus/AUTHORING.md) |
| A live wallpaper | an existing `livewalls/<id>/` | [`livewalls/README.md`](livewalls/README.md) |
| A fastfetch preset (terminal readout) | `fastfetch/ryoku-dossier/` | [`fastfetch/AUTHORING.md`](fastfetch/AUTHORING.md) |
| A Ryotunes skin (palette, type, radii, motion) | `ryotunes-skins/template/` | [`ryotunes-skins/AUTHORING.md`](ryotunes-skins/AUTHORING.md) |
| A lockscreen, bar style, launcher image, decor | an existing item in that catalogue | copy the layout of a neighbour |

A colour scheme is the simplest: add `colorschemes/<name>/` following an existing
scheme's layout, then add its entry to `colorschemes/registry.json`.

Built a plugin in your own shell? `ryoku plugin export <id>` writes a ready folder
and `registry-entry.json`, and `ryoku plugin share <id>` opens the pull request for
you (with `gh` logged in) or prefills the submission form. Doing it by hand instead,
regenerate the plugin's manifest and hash with `tools/pack-product.py plugins/<id>`.

## Two ways to submit

### 1. Open a pull request (preferred)

If you are comfortable with git, this is the fastest path and the one that
scales:

1. Fork this repo and add your item folder plus its `registry.json` entry.
2. Run the check from the repo root:

   ```sh
   tests/validate-catalogue.sh
   ```

   It confirms every item resolves to a real folder, manifest, and installer,
   and that all JSON parses. CI runs the same check, so a green local run means
   a green PR.
3. Open the pull request. The [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
   walks you through the checklist.

### 2. Fill in the submission form

Not set up for a pull request, or want a maintainer to help land it? Open the
[**submission form**](https://github.com/neur0map/ryostore/issues/new?template=submit-item.yml).
Tell us the kind, a short description, where the content lives (a repo, gist, or
zip), and a preview image. A maintainer reviews it and opens the pull request
with you.

## What every submission needs

- A **preview image** that is a real screenshot, not a placeholder.
- A **licence** you can honour: your own work, CC0, or content explicitly
  licensed for redistribution. Say so in the item's README or manifest.
- A **`registry.json` entry** with the fields your catalogue's guide lists,
  `lastUpdated` in `YYYY-MM-DD`, and (for community work) `official: false`.
- **`tests/validate-catalogue.sh` passing.**

That is the whole contract. When in doubt, copy the closest existing item and
change one thing at a time.
