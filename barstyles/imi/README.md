# Imi — Material 3 Island Bar

A Material 3-inspired top bar style for **Ryoku Desktop Shell**.  
Ported and adapted from the Immaterial Impulse dotfiles (end-4).

Note to neuromap : i just realized that there are a couple unnecessary leftover qml files. since the bar is a heavily customized fork, it shouldnt be hard to see which files are trash, you can remove them yourself or lmk if you need me to do some changes. 

## Features

- **Island Architecture** — Three rounded pill groups (left, center, right) with independent blur regions and configurable corner styles.
- **Morphing Popouts** — Popout cards smoothly animate position and size when hovering between widgets. Cards stay hidden until content is loaded (no top-left flash).
- **Kanji Workspaces** — Workspace indicators using Japanese numerals with click and scroll navigation. Supports multi-monitor and configurable workspace count.
- **Audio Visualizer** — Native MusicBars spectrum visualizer via PipeWire, embedded in the media pill alongside MPRIS controls (artist, title, album art).
- **System Gauges** — CPU, RAM, and temperature ring gauges with animated fills.
- **Weather Widget** — Current conditions, hourly forecast chart, and multi-day outlook via popout card.
- **Calendar Popout** — Clock + calendar grid popout with locale-aware formatting.
- **Privacy Indicator** — Mic, camera, and screencast status chips that appear/disappear with smooth animations.
- **Submap Indicator** — Hyprland keybind submap pill (e.g. resize mode) with auto-hide.
- **System Tray** — Collapsible tray icons with overflow.
- **Matugen Theming** — Full dynamic color palette from Ryoku's Matugen integration.
- **Edit Mode** — Drag-and-drop widget reordering via Bar Studio.
- **Multi-Monitor** — Per-output Scopes with boundary-aware popout positioning.

## Configuration

All options are exposed through Ryoku Settings > Bar section and stored in `~/.config/ryoku/shell.json` under the `bar` key:

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `bar.cornerStyle` | `0` = rounded, `3` = Material 3 islands | `3` |
| `bar.vertical` | Vertical bar mode | `false` |
| `bar.shadow` | Drop shadow under bar background | `true` |
| `bar.workspaces.shown` | Number of workspace indicators | `10` |
| `bar.workspaces.showAllMonitors` | Show workspaces from all monitors | `false` |
| `bar.layouts.left` | Widget order for the left pill | `[...]` |
| `bar.layouts.center` | Widget order for the center pill | `[...]` |
| `bar.layouts.right` | Widget order for the right pill | `[...]` |

## Dependencies

- **Ryoku Desktop Shell** (Quickshell-based)
- **Hyprland** compositor
- **PipeWire** (for audio visualizer)
- **Python 3** (installer only)

No external scripts or binaries are bundled — the bar runs entirely within Quickshell's QML engine using Ryoku's native services (`shell.services`, `shell.barkit`).
