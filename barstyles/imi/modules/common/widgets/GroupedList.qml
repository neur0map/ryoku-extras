/**
 * A list of rows drawn as one grouped surface: each row gets its own tinted
 * plate, the outer corners are rounded and the inner ones are not.
 *
 * ---- a row that comes and goes declares `rowVisible`, never `visible` -------
 *
 * The plates are built by a `Repeater` over the declared items and each one
 * sizes itself from its item's `implicitHeight`. That arithmetic never asked
 * whether the item was drawn, so a row hidden with `visible: false` kept its
 * plate: a row-height band of `bgcolor` with nothing in it. Two call sites had
 * it - the desktop menu's Edit layout row, which disappears while Edit Mode is
 * on, and Settings > Services > Weather's API-key field, which is OWM-only.
 *
 * The fix cannot be for the plate to mirror its item's `visible`, and that is
 * worth stating because it is the obvious shape. `Item.visible` reads back
 * EFFECTIVE visibility - the item's own flag AND its parents' - and the item is
 * a descendant of the plate, so a plate that hid itself from it would hide the
 * item too, and the item would then report false for ever. Probed with `qml6`
 * against a control row: the item toggled true/false/true while the mirrored
 * one read `false` on every one of the four samples after the first hide.
 *
 * So the declaration is a property of its own. A row that never disappears
 * declares nothing and reads `undefined`, which takes the `?? true` and costs
 * one property lookup.
