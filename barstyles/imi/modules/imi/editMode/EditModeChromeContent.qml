/**
 * Edit Mode's chrome: the toolbar above the shrunk desktop and the tab bar
 * below it.
 *
 * Split out of the surface that hosts it for the reason `EditModeCard` is split
 * out of `Background.qml` - weston implements no wlr-layer-shell, so the only
 * way anything here is ever looked at by a test is as a plain `Item` a probe
 * can put in a window of its own.
 *
 * ---- where it sits --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Everything is placed off `card`, the rectangle the desktop is drawn at, which
 * is `edit_mode.js`'s `cardRect` - the same arithmetic the desktop's own
 * transform is built out of. So the chrome cannot be a pixel off the thing it
 * frames, and it does not need a second copy of the geometry to be wrong about.
 *
 * That also gives the motion for free, and gives it the RIGHT shape: `card` is
 * a function of `GlobalStates.editProgress`, so the toolbar rises out of the
 * top edge and the tab bar out of the bottom one exactly as fast as the desktop
 * shrinks away from them. At progress 0 both bands have zero height and both
 * pieces are parked half off screen, which is why nothing here needs a
 * `Behavior` of its own - and must not have one: a Behavior whose target moves
 * every frame restarts every frame and never ticks (b710ef731 ("fix(plugins):
 * stop the position Behavior swallowing the parallax cancellation")).
 *
 * ---- what it is made of ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `Toolbar` and `ToolbarTabBar`, which is the shell's M3 expressive toolbar and
 * its toolbar tab bar - the same pieces the cheatsheet, the region selector,
 * the recording controls and the lock islands are built from. A bespoke card
 * matching the desktop's own outline and 30px corner was the other option and
 * would have been a second toolbar look minted for one mode, which is the drift
 * this repo keeps paying for. What ties it to the card is the shadow both carry
 * and the symmetry of the two bands, not a copied radius.
