// One always-mapped layer surface per screen, hosting the single card every bar
// popup morphs. The surface itself never moves, resizes or unmaps: on a
// layer-shell surface position *is* `margins`, so animating a popup along the
// bar reconfigures its surface every frame, which is the create-map-destroy
// loop StyledPopup's imperative positioning already exists to avoid.
//
// The card carries all the motion instead, and `mask: Region { item: card }`
// keeps the rest of the screen click-through. A 0x0 card builds an empty input
// region, which makes Qt mark the whole surface transparent for input - that is
// the invariant that lets a full-screen Overlay surface stay mapped forever.
